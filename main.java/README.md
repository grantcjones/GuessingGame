# Overview

{This is a game in which a player selects a range and guesses a number within that range in a specific amount of guesses based off of the length of the range. This is all controlled using functions, variables, and loops with conditionals. Additionally, usernames and passwords are saved, and a returning player must use their credentials to log in. This is handled with a .dat file and a Player and PlayerAccountManager classes, and Player uses 'implements' to access the Serializable class, since the program must save to a file.}

{My purpose in writing this software was to both practice and demonstrate my understanding of Java, as well as hopefully teach about searching algorithms in the future.}

# Development Environment

{I used Visual Studio Code as my editor and used JDK to be able to run Java on VS Code.}

{This project utilized the Java language and the standard List, Scanner, and Random libraries, as well as the Serializable class.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Item 1: Allow users to retry entering usernames and passwords to account for mistyping.
- Item 2: Create a leaderboard to showcase players' skills.
- Item 3: Possibly find another filetype to save player data in to make it more readable in the future. The .dat file worked really well, but it is hard to look at the users themselves for future development.
- Item 4: Create an option for a user to delete an account.
- Item 5: Create an option to play again or log out and/or quit.
